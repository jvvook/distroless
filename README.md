# Distroless base images

Custom distroless base images based on [Clear Linux OS](//clearlinux.org/) for my personal use

## Differences from [GoogleContainerTools/distroless](//github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)

-   Based on [Clear Linux OS](//clearlinux.org/), a Linux distribution optimized for Intel processors
-   Simple dockerfile-based build
-   Only two varients (cc/python) Ã— one architecture (amd64)
-   cc variant does not contain OpenSSL.
-   python varient has several compatibility breaks. it...
    -   does not contain a shell, and thus [`os.system()` won't work](//github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/issues/601).
    -   is built without terminal (`ncurses`, `readline`) and embedded db (`gdbm`, `sqlite`) support.
    -   is built with LibreSSL, and thus [lacks some hash algorithms](//peps.python.org/pep-0644/#libressl-support).
    -   supports only one major version of Python, chosen at my discretion.
